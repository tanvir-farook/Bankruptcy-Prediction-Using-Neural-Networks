# 🧠 Bankruptcy Prediction Using Neural Networks

This project explores predictive modeling for corporate bankruptcy using a real-world dataset with a severe class imbalance (~3% bankrupt firms). We employed advanced sampling techniques and neural network architectures in SAS Enterprise Miner to achieve over **96% accuracy**.

🔍 Key Highlights:
- Tackled class imbalance using oversampling techniques
- Designed and tuned neural network models (MLP) in SAS Enterprise Miner
- Analyzed the most influential financial indicators driving bankruptcy
- Validated model performance across multiple random partitions

📌 Tools & Techniques:
- **SAS Enterprise Miner**
- **Neural Networks (MLP)**
- **Oversampling for Imbalanced Data**
- **ROC/AUC Analysis**
