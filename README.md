This project explores predictive modeling for corporate bankruptcy using a real-world dataset with a severe class imbalance (~3% bankrupt firms). We employed advanced sampling techniques and neural network architectures in SAS Enterprise Miner to achieve over **96% accuracy**.

🔍 Key Features:
- Addressed class imbalance with oversampling and partitioned validation
- Tuned neural network hyperparameters for optimal predictive performance
- Evaluated model stability and robustness across multiple runs
- Delivered actionable insights on financial health indicators most associated with bankruptcy risk

📌 Technologies Used:
- **SAS Enterprise Miner**
- **Neural Networks** (Multilayer Perceptrons)
- **Imbalanced Classification Techniques** (oversampling, cost-sensitive learning)
